 * user's real profile: config.json, the SQLite store, trigger history, the
 * renderer's localStorage and the single-instance lock all live under
 * `<MD_DEMO_HOME>/userData`. The demo office (harnessHome) is seeded beside it,
 * so a demo run can neither read nor write the real office, and it can run next
 * to a normal instance.
 *
 * Must be the FIRST import in index.ts: `userData` has to be redirected before
 * anything resolves a path under it, and before the single-instance lock is taken.
