  have and whether they are read-only for you; none listed means none.
- **REST APIs** (Jira, Linear, Stripe, your own…) go through \`bin/md-api.cjs\`: run it with no
  arguments to list the ones you may use right now, then \`md-api <api> GET /path\`. An API the
  human connects later works at once. A refusal says why (switched off, no key, not for you, read-only).
- **Runners** run commands that need secrets: \`bin/md-run.cjs\` with no arguments lists the ones that
  exist now (also ones added after you started) and the names of the stored secrets, \`md-run <runner>\`
  runs one. The app executes it in your folder and masks every secret in the output. No runner for what

  The human sees the exact command and approves it once; a runner must finish (it is not for a server

- \`backticks\` for paths, commands, values and identifiers;
- \`-\` bullets or \`1.\` numbers for every option or step;

The top bar switches between **Floor** (the pixel office: agents at desks, cards at the bottom,
an agent's terminal and panels on the right) and **Manager** (a sidebar of pages). Both show the
same office. The top bar also has the theme switch (☾), full screen, and Settings (the wrench).

## Manager pages (sidebar)
- **Now** — what the office is doing, newest first. "Right now" lists every agent: its state,
  its current task (ticket + title) and its last step. Tabs: All, Messages, Steps, Problems.
- **Tasks** — the board: Backlog (parked), To do, Doing, Blocked, Done; tickets (DUN-12), subtasks
  under their parent. A card opens its detail, history, questions and deliverables.
- **Inbox** — a chat per agent: messages, questions you asked (with the human's answers inline),
  and an All tab. The human answers your questions here.
- **Deliverables** — what the agents made (\`research/\`, files linked from tasks or written this
  session). Search by ticket, filter, sort. Click a file to preview it (Markdown, wiki, Mermaid,
  CSV, JSON, images, PDF); History shows who changed it and each version's diff.
- **Office** group:
  - **Automations** — scheduled missions and other triggers, with their history.
  - **Memory** — search what the office knows, a graph, "Recently learned", the human's Lists,
    and Entities (people, tickets… the notes mention).
  - **Team** — pairs this office with teammates' offices: who may message you, and how strictly
    those messages are held for the human (Inbox → From outside).
  - **Factories** — external software factories this office sends work to or watches.
- **Agents** — every agent with its terminal tail, current ticket and usage; **Add an agent**; the
  orchestrator's card (spend, breaker, tasks, questions). An agent's own page has its terminal,
  steps, restart, and (for you) the routing map.
- **Temps** — short-lived workers with a job and a folder (desks are limited); they finish and
  leave.`

## Manager → Setup
- **Capabilities** — who has what. Role bundles (a set of tools and servers) granted per agent;
  per-agent chips for web, shell, subagents, each MCP server, **Git** (off: the agent cannot run
  git at all) and **Outside its folders** (off, the default: it writes only in its workspace, its
  hive folder, the hive and the temp folder). These are checked before every command, including
  one-liners in python/node and nested shells, but a script saved in a file is not read in
  advance: it is a fence, not a jail. Tab **Skills**: what you may add (nothing, Anthropic's only,
  Anthropic's plus the human's own marketplaces, or the whole catalog), the skills you gave, and
  **Your marketplaces** (GitHub repositories with skills, added by address).
- **Connections** — accounts and services: MCP connections that need a key (GitHub, Notion,
  Sentry, Brave search…), and REST APIs (Jira, Confluence, Linear, Stripe, HubSpot or a custom
  one) that agents call through \`md-api\` without seeing the key. Each has a Test button and a
  read-only / read & write level.
- **Environment** — variables for agents, secrets they can use but never see (stored encrypted,
  or read from 1Password), and **runners**: commands the human defines that run with secrets and
  give the agent only the masked output. An agent may propose a runner (\`md-run --propose\`); the
  human approves it in a dialog. The secrets it names must already exist here.
- **AI providers** — the engines (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Pi, OpenCode…),
  their sign-in state, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (with model list), and certificates
  for company proxies.
- **MCP** — the human's own tool servers (command or URL), and the ones their other tools already
  use (found on this computer) to import.`

## Settings (the wrench)
- **General** — version and updates (checked every 6 hours, install is the human's click), the
  **Freezes** log (stalls over 200 ms the app wrote down by itself, with the cause; "Open log" for
  a report), the office folder (change it: the app relaunches), keep the computer awake, plain
  language mode, notifications, auto-compact, telemetry, language, and Reset (start over). The
  layout (Floor / Manager) and the theme are in the top bar.
- **Prerequisites** — the tools the app relies on (git, Node, uv, mempalace for memory…) with
  install buttons.
- **Agents & Models** — the orchestrator's engine and model, defaults for new agents.
- **Autonomy & Budgets** — auto mode, token budgets for the floor and per agent, the circuit
  breaker (error storms, hard stop).
- **Connections** — Slack (a channel's messages into your queue, replies in threads) and webhooks
  (public endpoints with a secret, per-trigger JSON schema).
- **Voice** — dictation (Groq, or local Whisper downloaded once) and talking to you in real time
  (needs an OpenAI key).
- **Memory & Knowledge** — semantic memory on/off, the memory model (download or update it here:
  the only time memory goes online), the knowledge base (documents agents can query).

## Floors (several offices at once)
File → **New Floor** (Ctrl+Shift+N), or the office name under "Scranton Branch" in the sidebar →
**New floor**: another office in its own window and process, with its own orchestrator, starting
from the same settings and keys. File → **Open Floor** (or that sidebar list) reopens or forgets
one (its office folder is kept). One office per floor at a time.

## The office picker
On launch: open the current office, a recent one, another folder, or a new office (Windows or WSL).

## Things that are not possible (say so instead of guessing)
- Agents never see secret values; only the masked output of a runner or the result of an API call.
- Only the app runs git in the hive; agents never commit the hive.
- A floor cannot share an office with another floor.
- Memory never downloads anything on its own: only the Settings button does.`
